# Highlight-Previous-Div-with-jQuery
This HTML document demonstrates a simple jQuery script for highlighting the previous &lt;div> element when any &lt;div> is clicked. If the clicked &lt;div> is the first one, it changes its own background color and displays an alert message.
The page features multiple <div> elements styled with CSS to have borders and padding. The jQuery script handles the click event on each <div>, changing the background color of the previous sibling <div> to green, or displaying an alert if the clicked <div> is the first one.
